# Random Number Evaluation

This program assigns a random signed number to the variable "number" each time it is executed. The objective is to determine whether the number stored in the "number" variable is positive, negative, or zero, and print the corresponding result.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the "2-pon.py" file.
4. Run the Python script by executing the command `python 2-pon.py`.

Upon running the script, a random number will be assigned to the "number" variable, and the program will display the evaluation of the number as follows:

- If the number is greater than 0: "The number is positive"
- If the number is equal to 0: "The number is zero"
- If the number is less than 0: "The number is negative"

Please note that the output will vary each time you run the program due to the random assignment of numbers.
